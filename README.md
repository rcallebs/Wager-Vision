## Description

After signing up, users can enter their bets with detailed information including the odds, stake, and events that were included in the bet.

All app users can view upcoming sporting events and live odds for each event.

Registered users can view all past bets and see a details page for their betting history that shows overall wins/losses along with their profit/loss margin.
